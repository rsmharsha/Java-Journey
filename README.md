      ☕ Java-Journey ☕

A collection of Java programs and mini-projects I’m writing while learning Java.  
From “Hello World” to things like a Mortgage Calculator — all my experiments and exercises go here.

## 📌 About
This repository is my personal playground for learning Java.  
It contains everything I code while studying Java — simple exercises, small projects, or practical programs like a Mortgage Calculator.  
Expect some messy code, creative solutions, and occasional moments of “why won’t this compile?!”

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Java-Journey.git
````

2. Navigate to the repository:

   ```bash
   cd Java-Journey
   ```
3. Compile a program:

   ```bash
   javac ProgramName.java
   ```
4. Run the program:

   ```bash
   java ProgramName
   ```

## 📖 Notes

* Programs are exercises or mini-projects from my learning journey.
* Code may be messy, simple, or over-engineered — all part of learning.
* Feedback, tips, or jokes about my code are welcome via issues or pull requests.

## 🛠 Environment

* **Java Version:** (e.g., Java 17)
* **IDE:** (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)

## ✨ Goals

* Upload all Java programs I create while learning.
* Track progress and build small projects as I improve.
* Cry slightly less while debugging.
