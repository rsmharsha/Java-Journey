# Java Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Java playground! 🖥️  
This repository is a collection of Java programs that grow in complexity as I continue learning the language — starting from the classic *Hello World* and moving towards more advanced concepts.

The goal of this repo is to track my progress, practice writing clean and efficient code, and build a solid foundation in Java programming.

As I learn, I’ll keep updating this repository with new examples, experiments, and projects — gradually moving from the basics to more advanced topics.

## 🎯 Goals of This Repo

- Document my learning journey in Java.  
- Practice and improve coding skills through hands-on examples.  
- Build a resource that I (and maybe others) can revisit as a reference.
