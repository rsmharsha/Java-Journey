# Java Basic Oops Implementation

This folder contains basic Java classes demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The examples cover class design, constructors, method and constructor overloading, static fields and methods, encapsulation (getters and setters), and basic usage of objects.

## Files

- **Main.java**  
  Entry point for the demo. Shows how to create `Employee` objects, use overloaded constructors, and call static and instance methods.

- **Employee.java**  
  Demonstrates:
    - Instance and static fields (e.g., `baseSalary`, `hourlyRate`, `numberOfEmployees`)
    - Constructor overloading
    - Method overloading (`calculateWage`)
    - Static methods
    - Encapsulation using getters and setters
    - Input validation in setters

- **TextBox.java**  
  Simple class illustrating fields, methods, and how an object's state can be changed via methods. Example of public field (`text`) and methods (`setText`, `clear`).

- **Browser.java**  
  Simulates basic browser behavior with methods to "navigate" to an address, showing private helper methods and internal logic.
